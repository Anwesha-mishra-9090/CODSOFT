🚢 Excited to share my first project for the CodSoft Data Science Internship — **Titanic Survival Prediction**!

📊 In this project, I used machine learning to predict whether a passenger would survive the Titanic tragedy using:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Data cleaning, encoding, and feature selection

💡 Tools Used: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn

✅ Achieved solid accuracy and saved the model for deployment!

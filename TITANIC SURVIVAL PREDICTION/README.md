# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction - CodSoft Data Science Internship Task

This is a machine learning project for my **CodSoft Data Science Internship (June 2025 Batch - B31)**.  
The goal is to build a predictive model that determines whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, sex, fare, class, etc.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- Dataset provided by CodSoft: `Titanic-Dataset.csv`
- Columns include: `PassengerId`, `Pclass`, `Name`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Ticket`, `Fare`, `Cabin`, `Embarked`, `Survived`

---

## 🧠 Features & Techniques

- Handled missing values (`Age`, `Cabin`, `Embarked`)
- Encoded categorical variables (Sex, Embarked)
- Dropped non-informative features (Name, Ticket, PassengerId)
- Trained on multiple models:
  - ✅ Logistic Regression
  - ✅ Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluated using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
- Saved final model using `joblib`

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib

---

## 🎯 Accuracy

Achieved good prediction accuracy using Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
